# 🎄 **Family Playlist Guessing Game — Rules & Scoring**

## **1. Goal of the Game**

A song is played from one of the siblings’ Spotify playlists.
Parents guess **whose playlist** the song is from and earn points.
Bonus knowledge earns **multipliers** that greatly increase the score.

---

# 🎯 **2. Base Points**

You must guess the correct sibling to earn any points.

- **Correct sibling:** **10 points**
- No penalties for wrong guesses

_All other bonuses only apply if the sibling guess is correct._

---

# 🔢 **3. Multipliers**

All bonus items stack **multiplicatively**, making correct guesses very impactful.

### **Artist Name Correct**

→ **× 2**

### **Song Title Correct**

→ **× 2**

### **Older or Newer Compared to Previous Song Correct**

(Using release year)
→ **× 1.5**

**Optional:**
If both songs are from the _same year_ and “same year” is guessed → also **× 1.5**

---

# 🧮 **4. Scoring Formula**

```
Final Score =
10
× (2 if artist correct else 1)
× (2 if song title correct else 1)
× (1.5 if older/newer correct else 1)
```

---

# 💥 **5. Examples**

### **Only sibling correct**

```
10 × 1 × 1 × 1 = 10 points
```

### **Sibling + artist**

```
10 × 2 × 1 × 1 = 20 points
```

### **Sibling + artist + title**

```
10 × 2 × 2 × 1 = 40 points
```

### **Sibling + older/newer**

```
10 × 1 × 1 × 1.5 = 15 points
```

### **All correct**

```
10 × 2 × 2 × 1.5 = 60 points
```
